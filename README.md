# Introduction to Neurotechnology

This course is under reconstruction -- slides will be available publicly as they are completed.

### Notes

* We are assuming course takers do not have access to an EEG headset such as the Muse or an OpenBCI. This assumption allows us to scale the course as a UC Berkeley DeCal as well as a MOOC on edX and Coursera.
* We will present demos with EEG headsets and make code/specs available to course takers.
* Homework/labs will be delivered through Jupyter notebooks.
* Potential topics include:
    * EEG
    * Signal processing
    * EMG
    * Elementary neuroscience
    * MRI/fMRI
    * Using Python and numpy/sklearn/matplotlib
