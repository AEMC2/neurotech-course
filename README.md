The planned labs are as follows:

- [Lab 1: Getting started with EEG](http://docs.openbci.com/Tutorials/02-Ganglion_Getting%20Started_Guide)
- Lab 2: Sensory extension
- [Lab 3: Detecting event-related potentials](lab3)
- [Lab 4: Neurofeedback](lab4)
- [Lab 5: Steady-state visually evoked potentials](lab5)
- [Lab 6: Detecting stress using biosignals](lab6)
- [Lab 7: Measuring attention using cross-brain correlations](lab7)
