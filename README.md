# Intro to Brain Computer Interfaces

These are the course materials for the UC Berkeley [decal](http://www.decal.org/) [Intro to Brain Computer Interfaces](http://neurotechberkeley.org/course/info.html).


### Labs
The planned labs are as follows:

- Lab 1: Setting up EEG to record data
- Lab 2: Detecting event-related potentials
- Lab 3: Steady-state visually evoked potentials
- Lab 4: Neurofeedback
- Lab 5: Detecting stress using biosignals
- Lab 6: Cross-brain correlations, reward using event-related potentials
- Lab 7: Detecting arm movements neck tension from EMG
- Lab 8: Detecting stages of sleep using EEG
