# Intro to Brain Computer Interfaces

These are the course materials for [Intro to Brain Computer Interfaces](http://neurotechberkeley.org/course/info.html).

The course consists of labs and lectures. We will host all the labs here. The lectures will be linked on the [course website](http://neurotechberkeley.org/course/schedule.html).

### Labs
The planned labs are as follows:

- [Lab 1: Getting started with EEG](http://docs.openbci.com/Tutorials/02-Ganglion_Getting%20Started_Guide)
- Lab 2: Sensory extension
- [Lab 3: Detecting event-related potentials](lab3)
- Lab 4: Neurofeedback
- Lab 5: Steady-state visually evoked potentials
- Lab 6: Detecting stress using biosignals
- Lab 7: Cross-brain correlations, reward using event-related potentials
- Lab 8: Detecting arm movements neck tension from EMG
- Lab 9: Detecting stages of sleep using EEG
